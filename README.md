Aircraft Routing Problem ( ARP ) using Network Flow algorithms : 

(i)The Aircraft Routing Problem (ARP) is formulated as a time-dependent network flow
problem and proved to be NP-Hard, using a reduction from the NP-Complete 3-
Dimensional Matching Problem (3DM).

(ii)Flow scheduling and dynamic network theory concepts are used to develop an Integer
Program (IP) formulation of the ARP, which can be solved exactly through software
such as CPLEX. Linear Program (LP) relaxation and rounding techniques are used to
solve this formulation in pseudo-polynomial time .

(iii)The approach (algorithm) taken from a paper ( by Kaushik Roy ) published in an IEEE
conference.Aim is to implement it and simulate its performance.

(iv)Languages and Tools :- C , C++14 , CPLEX
